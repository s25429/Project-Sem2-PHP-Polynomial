## General Information
A simple application made to visualise a polynomial function for *a* possibly having a maximum power of three. Any lower down to y = 0 will work as well.\
This is a project made for the university I am studying at, mainly for a PHP course on my 2nd semester.\
The project uses some basic knowledge of Object Oriented Programming and the whole class structure allows for easy change in how the data created should be displayed. Currently it is shown by use of CanvasHTML item and corresponding to it JavaScript methods. It can be easily altered to suit any other way of displaying data, as specific classes store limited information that is strictly only for them to process and no more.\
Whole project was coded in PHPStorm and class Data includes #[Pure] attribute. It should not interfere with launching of the code. If it does, simply removing the attribute in code should do the trick.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3
- PHP 8.1
- JavaScript

## Launching and Viewing
- To launch the project you will need either fully configured PHPStorm or simply XAMPP would do just fine as well. I suggest PHPStorm as it's the most straight forward option.
- For PHPStorm it's as easy as opening the project and then launching 'Open in Browser' on index.php file. 
- For XAMPP you first need to turn the server on in the control panel and then move the project folder to XAMPP's htdocs. Then you can simply type in your browser `localhost:port/folder_name` and you should see a working project. If you see errors that might be due to either badly configured XAMPP or wrong PHP version. 

## Project Status
Project is fully complete and there is nothing more from me to add to it. Although if any critical bugs would be found I would take my time to fix them so that the project is at least working adequately for its sole purpouse.
